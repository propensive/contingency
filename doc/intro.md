Perforate is an experimental library for abstracting over error handling. In
particular, it gives developers a choice between throwing exceptions, returning
errors in a variety of datatypes, and accumulating several validation-style
errors. Code must be written to accomodate Perforate's generic
error handling, but the changes from exception-throwing code are trivial.
